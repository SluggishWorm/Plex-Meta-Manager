    summary: Justice League The Flashpoint Paradox - resets timelines and combines them into one and Justice League War is the new beginning to a new timeline (animated films based on The New 52 continuity). Else World Movies are Batman Assault on Arkham, Justice League Gods and Monstera, Batman The Killing Joke and Batman Gotham By Gaslight. CW Seeds Constantine City of Demons, does not follow Constantine from Arrowverse. Instead it is the Constantine from JL Dark movie. But maybe later they will connect it to Arrowverse somehow.
